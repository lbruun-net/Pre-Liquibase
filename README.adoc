Companion to https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-execute-liquibase-database-migrations-on-startup[Spring Boot Liquibase module]
which allows to execute some SQL script file _prior_ to executing https://www.liquibase.org/[Liquibase] ChangeSets.

Why? While you should be using Liquibase for all your DDL there's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: 
The database and schema where Liquibase puts itself into obviously cannot be created by Liquibase itself.
This module solves this problem by allowing you to "deploy" such DB prerequisites as part of your application code.
Typical use is to create database schema or database catalog so that Liquibase objects have "a home" where
they can live.

*Pre-Liquibase* is a Spring Boot auto-configuration module. You only need to add the dependency as well
as the SQL script you want executed prior to Liquibase execution. There is no Java code for you to add to your project.

WARNING: Whatever you put in your SQL script file(s) for this module should be something which Liquibase cannot handle.
(example: creating a schema for Liquibase's own use). You are using Liquibase for a reason so you should have _all_ of
your table model initialization in Liquibase ChangeSets. Most likely your SQL file for this module will be a one-liner. 
If not, you should pause and ask yourself if you are doing the right thing.

The module requires 

- Java 17 or later (artifacts before `1.3` only require Java 8 but do not support Spring Boot 3)
- Spring Boot 3.1 or later (for older versions see <<Spring Boot compatibility>>)

== When to use this module?

- You want to setup database pre-requisites for Liquibase as part of your application code.
- You want to use the same database user for several environments (for the same application) but
you want each environment to use its own schema or own catalog. This is an inexpensive and simple
way of hosting multiple "editions" of your application on the same database server, for example your
'dev1, 'dev2', 'uat' and 'sit' environments can all use the same database user without clashing
with each other.
- You want to isolate tests from each other.
- Anything you can think of (but be sure not to use the module for something which Liquibase itself
  should rightfully do)



== Quick start (Maven)

. Add the following dependency to your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.lbruun.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>preliquibase-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>  ---latest-version---  </version>
</dependency>
----
[start=2]
. Add SQL file(s) to folder `src/main/resources/preliquibase/` and name them `DBENGINECODE.sql` (where 'DBENGINECODE' is 
one of the string codes which are supported for database engine auto-detection, see <<auto_detection>>) or simply `default.sql` if 
the SQL file applies generically to any type of database engine. If your Pre-Liquibase script is about ensuring a 
schema exists (not unlikely, this is the main use-case for Pre-Liquibase) then your SQL script might look like this:

[source,text]
----
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ${spring.liquibase.default-schema};
----

and application properties like this:

[source,properties]
----
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.default_schema=${my.db.schemaname}
spring.liquibase.default-schema=${my.db.schemaname}
----

Now - in this example - the only thing left to decide is where the `my.db.schemaname` value
comes from. That is your choice. The link:examples/example1/[example project] advocates
that it should come from an OS environment variable, in particular if your are
deploying to a cloud.


Done!



== Usage 

The module is a Spring Boot auto-configuration. Once you add the dependency to your application it will automatically
trigger its own auto-configuration if you also have Liquibase in your classpath. The module will make
sure it always fires _before_ Liquibase itself. The module has no effect if you add it to
a Spring Boot project which does not use Liquibase.

The module will search for SQL script files in pre-defined locations and execute those. You can have separate SQL scripts
for various database platforms (for example one for PostgreSQL and another for MS SQL Server, etc). At runtime the type of
database will be auto-detected so that the right SQL script is executed.

SQL script files can contain replacement variables on the form `${propertyName}` or `${propertyName:defaultValue}` so
as to make your SQL script file dynamic. The property will be resolved from your application's Spring Environment.

You can find an example project link:examples/example1/[here].


=== Maven dependency

The module's artifacts are available from Maven Central. True to how Spring Boot auto-configuration is organized you simply add a "Starter" 
to your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.lbruun.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>preliquibase-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>  ---latest-version---  </version>
</dependency>
----

=== SQL Script syntax

The module uses the Spring Framework's build-in support for parsing and executing the SQL script file(s).

Rules for the file are:

- The syntax used must be native to your target database platform. You cannot use constructs from higher-level
  tools such as SQL*Plus (Oracle), `psql` (PostgreSQL) or `sqlcmd` (MS SQL Server).
- Statements ends with a semi-colon character. (by default, can be <<Configuration,customized>>)
- Comment lines start with `--`.
- Replacement variables on the form `${propertyName}` or `${propertyName:defaultValue}` can appear
  anywhere in the file so as to make your SQL script file dynamic. The property will be resolved from 
  your application's Spring Environment. Replacement is done indiscriminately: it doesn't matter if the replacement
  variable is inside quotes; it will still be replaced.
- The script should be idempotent code (only-create-if-not-already-exists statements), execute quickly 
  and generally be without side effects. Remember that the SQL script will be executed _every_ time 
  your application starts. Also, unlike Liquibase itself, Pre-Liquibase does not have a mechanism
  to ensure that the script only executes on only one node if your application is multi-node. To mitigate
  this the script should ideally be one atomic unit which the database engine can execute. Yet
  another reason why you would probably want to have only a single SQL statement in your script.
- Don't bother putting SELECT statements in the script. The result will not be shown anywhere.



=== How the module locates SQL script files [[sql_scripts_lookup]]

Pre-Liquibase locates the SQL script(s) to execute based on the value of the `sqlScriptReferences` 
configuration property. The default for this property is `classpath:/preliquibase/`.

In general, `sqlScriptReferences` is interpreted as a comma-separated list of 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#resources-resource-strings[Spring Resource textual
references]. It can be configured to either "folder mode" or "file mode":


1. Folder mode: Configure `sqlScriptReferences` to a single value ending in the "/" character.
In this mode the value will be interpreted as a folder location where SQL scripts to be executed
are found. From this folder, if a file named `preliquibase/DBPLATFORMCODE.sql` exists, it will be executed. 
`DBPLATFORMCODE` is a string code representing the type of database in use. The module will <<auto_detection,auto-detect>>
the database platform,  but you can optionally override the value with the `dbPlatformCode` configuration property. If no such file 
`preliquibase/DBPLATFORMCODE.sql` file exists the module will execute a file named `preliquibase/default.sql` if it exists.
If neither such file exists in the folder then no action will be taken (not an error).

2. File mode: Configure `sqlScriptReferences` to be a comma-separated list of individual SQL script files.
All of the SQL script files in the list will be executed, in the order they are listed.
Prior to execution of any SQL script file it is checked if all files mentioned actually exist, if not
a `PreLiquibaseException.SqlScriptRefError` is thrown.

NOTE: The way SQL script files are located and named is somewhat inspired by 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-initialize-a-database-using-spring-jdbc[Spring Boot's DataSource Initialization feature]. 
However, there are some important differences: Pre-Liquibase auto-detects which database platform you are using and secondly if a platform 
specific SQL script file is found then Pre-Liquibase will not attempt to _also_ execute the platform generic file (`default.sql`).



=== Database platform auto-detection [[auto_detection]]

The module does not attempt to interpret the SQL you put in your SQL script files. It does, however, have a feature 
for auto-detecting which database platform is in use. It uses this information to figure out which SQL script file to
execute. This is ideal if your application is meant to support multiple database platforms.

Simply name your SQL script `preliquibase/DBPLATFORMCODE.sql` and put it in the classpath. For example, you may name your SQL script
file `preliquibase/postgresql.sql` and such script will then only be executed if the database platform in use is PostgreSQL.

Auto-detection is accomplished using Liquibase library, hence the DBPLATFORMCODEs you can use are the same as
can be used in an Liquibase `dbms` Precondition. For reference, here's a list of some of them:

* `postgresql`. PostgreSQL
* `mysql`. MySQL
* `mariadb`. MariaDB
* `mssql`. Microsoft SQL Server
* `h2`. H2 database
* `hsqldb`. HyperSQL database
* `oracle`. Oracle Database
* `db2`. IBM Db2 on Linux, Unix and Windows
* `db2z`. IBM Db2 on zOS
* `derby`. Apache Derby
* `sqlite`. SQLite
* `sybase`. Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise
* `unsupported`. Database not supported by Liquibase




=== Configuration

The behavior of the module can be changed with the following configuration properties, prefixed with `preliquibase.`:

[cols=4*,options=header]
|===
|Property name
|Type
|Default
|Description

|enabled
|boolean
|true
|If the module is enabled or not?

|dbPlatformCode
|String
|null
|Database platform code used for locating SQL scripts which uses the naming form `preliquibase/DBPLATFORMCODE.sql` from classpath. 
Setting this property will override auto-detection of the database platform being used. 

|sqlScriptReferences
|CSV 
|`classpath:/preliquibase/`
|Comma-separated list of Spring Resource locations for where to find the SQL scripts 
which the module will execute. See <<sql_scripts_lookup>> for more information.

|continueOnError
|boolean 
|false
|Whether to stop with an RuntimeException if an error occurs while executing the SQL script. If `false`, script execution
will stop on first error and throw RuntimeException. If `true`, script execution will continue even there are errors
in the script and errors will be logged if logging level for `org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init` is at least
`DEBUG`.

Setting `continueOnError` to `true` should generally be avoided. It is probably a sign of your SQL script file(s) not being idempotent. 
You should work on that first and only use this setting as a last resort.

|separator
|String
|;
|The statement separator used in the SQL script(s).

|sqlScriptEncoding
|String
|UTF-8
|The character encoding for the SQL script file(s). The value must be the name of a JDK Charset, such as
`US-ASCII`, `ISO-8859-1`, `UTF-8` or `UTF-16`.

=== Spring Boot tests

==== Spring Boot test slices

Pre-Liquibase directly supports the following Spring Boot test slices:

- `@DataJdbcTest`  (since version 1.0.0)
- `@DataJpaTest`   (since version 1.5.1)
- `@DataR2dbcTest`   (since version 1.5.1)
- `@JdbcTest`   (since version 1.5.1)
- `@JooqTest`   (since version 1.5.1)

You can use the above annotations as you normally would because the Pre-Liquibase module
registers itself as one of the auto-configs which are in-scope when such annotation is applied to a test class.

The link:examples/example1/[example project] showcases this.


==== Pre-Liquibase used for test isolation

Performing integration tests against a database is best done using a fresh ephemeral database _for each test_.
For example, by using https://testcontainers.com/[TestContainers]. However, this is not always possible. For example
if the CI pipeline is already executing inside Docker. Looking at you GitLab. In such case you'll likely have only one
ephemeral database for all of the pipeline execution. This creates a problem of *test isolation*.
You can to some extend solve this problem by using the traditional Spring `@Sql` annotation to execute some SQL script
before each test. But such script will not fire _before_ Liquibase.
Pre-Liquibase is perfect for this use-case as you can use it to create database schemas on-the-fly.

Here is how:

. Add the Pre-Liquibase dependency to your project. If you only use Pre-Liquibase for testing, then:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.lbruun.springboot</groupId>
    <artifactId>preliquibase-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>  ---latest-version---  </version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

[start=2]
. Add SQL file(s) to folder `src/test/resources/preliquibase/`, for example file `postgresql.sql`:

[source,text]
----
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ${spring.liquibase.default-schema};
----

[start=3]
. Annotate your Spring Boot tests with `@TestPropertySource` so that you override the value for database
schema name, like so:

[source,java]
----
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE) // deactivate the default behaviour, YMMV
@DataJpaTest
@TestPropertySource(properties = {
    "spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.default_schema=mytest_382",
    "spring.liquibase.default-schema=mytest_382"
    })
public class PersistenceTest {
    ...
}
----

As a result, `PersistenceTest` will execute in its own database schema, `mytest_382`, which is created on-the-fly by
Pre-Liquibase. An additional benefit is that you can now perform testing in parallel: different tests will not interfere
with each other even if they use the same database.


=== Examples

- link:examples/example1/[Example 1]. Using Pre-Liquibase with a single datasource.
- link:examples/example2/[Example 2]. Using Pre-Liquibase with multiple datasources. This requires configuring
  beans yourself, not just for Pre-Liquibase but also for Liquibase, JPA/Hibernate and so on. The
  example application shows how to do this. (in many ways it is a show-case application for how to
  use multiple datasources in general in a Spring Boot application; the Pre-Liquibase part of it is trivial)


== Additional notes

=== Which DataSource is used?

The module will use the same DataSource as Spring Boot Liquibase module does. This seams
reasonable for an application with a single data source defined. However, it is possible to override this
by registering your own bean of type `PreLiquibaseDataSourceProvider` while still using auto-configuration
for everything else.

The other option is to configure the `PreLiquibase` bean(s) yourself in which case there's no need for
`PreLiquibaseDataSourceProvider`. Configuring `PreLiquibase` beans yourself will indeed be needed if the
application uses multiple data sources. Configuring the beans yourself allows unlimited flexibility.
However, it typically means you'll have to configure _all_ beans related to persistence
(Pre-Liquibase, Liquibase, JPA, JTA, etc) yourself as auto-configuration will back off.
An example of this can be found in link:example2/[Example 2].


=== To quote or not to quote?
You need to consider case (upper/lower) for the schema name. The SQL standard mandates that object names
are treated case-insensitive if the value is not quoted.

However, there's a quirk in Liquibase. While Liquibase in general offers offers control over SQL object
quoting behavior (by way of the `objectQuotingStrategy` attribute in your changelog) the same is not true
in respect to Liquibase system tables, i.e. DATACHANGELOG and DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK and their associated
schema name. Here Liquibase will always use the strategy named `LEGACY`. This means that SQL objects will be quoted
if they are of mixed case, otherwise not.
This may create unexpected results with regards to the name of the schema holding the Liquibase system tables.
Therefore, the advice is to *_use either all lower-case or all upper-case for schema name, never mixed case_*.
In short 'Foo_bar' is not a good value, but 'FOO_BAR' or 'foo_bar' is.

An example: 

Let's say you are asking Pre-Liquibase to execute a SQL script for PostgreSQL like this

[source,text]
----
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ${my.db.schemaname};
----

and you are then telling Liquibase to use the exact same value:

[source,properties]
----
spring.liquibase.default-schema=${my.db.schemaname}
----

All is good?  No, not so, if the value for `${my.db.schemaname}` is of mixed case, let's say `Foo_bar`,
Liquibase will attempt to create its system tables in a schema named `"Foo_bar"` (quoted) but the Pre-Liquibase
SQL script will have created a schema in the database server with name `foo_bar` so you'll get an 
error on Liquibase execution. Hence the recommendation to not use mixed-case for the schema name. Such strategy
will work with any database platform.



=== Troubleshooting

Turn on logging. Depending on what you want to dig into here are some properties you may want to set:

[source,properties]
----
debug=true
logging.level.org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure=DEBUG
logging.level.net.lbruun.springboot.preliquibase=TRACE
logging.level.liquibase=TRACE
----

Pre-Liquibase assumes that you are using auto-configuration for Liquibase as well. If you are manually
configuring a bean of type `SpringLiquibase` then Pre-Liquibase will not fire. You can find the background
for this explained in https://github.com/lbruun/Pre-Liquibase/issues/5[Issue #5]. In such case you'll have
to configure all beans yourself. You can find an example of this in link:example2/[Example 2] which you can
easily adapt to a single datasource use-case.

== Spring Boot compatibility

Current version works with Spring Boot 3.1+ and has been tested with version 3.1 and 3.2. There's no reason why it
should not work with any future 3.x release of Spring Boot.

== Alternatives

You can in theory use Spring Boot's DataSource initialization feature or JPA DDL or Hibernate DDL as described 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.data-initialization.using-basic-sql-scripts[here], 
but the Spring Boot guide clearly explains that you should not use such methods along side "a higher-level Database Migration Tool, 
like Flyway or Liquibase" because these methods are not guaranteed to execute before Liquibase and if they happen to do so 
at the moment, they might not in the future. In constrast the Pre-Liquibase module is designed specifically
for use with Liquibase and is guaranteed to _always_ execute before Liquibase itself.



== References

* Flyway, Liquibase competitor, has a feature for ensuring that the schema exists prior to executing the Flyway migration:  
  https://flywaydb.org/documentation/concepts/migrations.html#schema-creation[createSchemas option]. Liquibase has no equivalent feature.
* Executing some SQL prior to the Liquibase ChangeSets has been discussed several times on the Liquibase forum. Example threads:
