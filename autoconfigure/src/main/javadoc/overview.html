            Pre-Liquibase allows to execute some SQL script typically as
            part of application startup. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It is named 'Pre-Liquibase' because its main purpose is to execute
            SQL script (often a one-liner) <i>before</i> executing
            <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a>, for example
            to ensure that a schema exists.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Intended audience:</strong>
            Developer who needs to configure <code>PreLiquibase</code> bean manually
            rather than letting Spring Boot auto-configuration handle it.
